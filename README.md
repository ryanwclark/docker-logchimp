## Introduction

This will build a container for [logchimp](https://logchimp.io/) - An open source product evaluation tool

* This Container uses a [customized Alpine base](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanwclark/alpine) which includes [s6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) enabled for PID 1 Init capabilities, [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org) for individual container monitoring, Cron also installed along with other tools (bash,curl, less, logrotate, nano, vim) for easier management. It also supports sending to external SMTP servers..

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Prerequisites

This image assumes that you are using a reverse proxy such as
[jwilder/nginx-proxy](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) and optionally the [Let's Encrypt Proxy
Companion @
https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion)
or [Traefik](https://github.com/ryanwclark/docker-traefik) in order to serve your pages. However, it will run just fine on it's own if you map appropriate ports. See the examples folder for a docker-compose.yml that does not rely on a reverse proxy.

You will also need an external Postgresql container

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ryanwclark/logchimp) and is the recommended method of installation.

```bash
docker pull ryanwclark/logchimp
```

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [docker-compose.yml](examples/docker-compose.yml) that can be modified for development or production use.

* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Make [networking ports](#networking) available for public access if necessary

In reality all you wil need to do is populate the `APP_KEY` and `DB_*` environment variables to have a working solution.

## Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory | Description |
